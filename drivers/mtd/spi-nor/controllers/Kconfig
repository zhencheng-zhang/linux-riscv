	  Enable support for the NXP LPC SPI Flash Interface controller.

	  SPIFI is a specialized controller for connecting serial SPI
	  Flash. Enable this option if you have a device with a SPIFI
	  controller and want to access the Flash as a mtd device.

	  Enable support for the Sophgo SPI Flash Master controller.

	  SPIFMC is a master controller to control serial SPI Flash.
	  Enable this option if you have a device with a SPIFMC controller
	  and want to access the Flash as a mtd device.

	help
	  Enable DMMR(Direct Memory Mapping Read) read for Sophgo spifmc.

	  In DMMR mode, the read address on the AHB will be directly mapped
	  to the SPI Flash, and the controller automatically reads the data
	  from the corresponding address of the SPI Flash. There is no need
	  for software to set related commands and addresses. At this time,
	  SPI Flash can be used as ROM.
